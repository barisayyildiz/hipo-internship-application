# Hipo Internship Application

In this project I used Unsplash API to get images based on user input. Users can also pick a collection name.

I created **masonary grids** with the CSS property ’**columns**’.

I really tried to make it look like to the [assignment](https://www.figma.com/file/ZYsbwFkjHhHEuhsJ9RLgLd9y/Web-Homework?node-id=0%3A1) but I was not able to do any of the bonus tasks because of my midterm week.

To run the application in your local

```
git clone https://github.com/barisayyildiz/hipo-internship-application.git

cd hipo-internship-application

npm install

npm start
```

Thank you for your consideration,
